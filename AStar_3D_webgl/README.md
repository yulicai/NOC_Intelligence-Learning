# AStar algorithm, 3D, using webgl in threejs

### Based on Dan Shiffman example code for astar algorithm in 2D using p5

### Implementation
* make it 3D in three js, accessing attributes in shader
* capable of being interactive with mouse movement
* use plane javaScript instead of p5 framework

### Things to fix
* It seems to be always no solution, will fix it later
* More pleasant visual representative, found lots of things to play with in 3D
